    "input": "",
    "response": "Human evolution began millions of years ago with the emergence of common ancestors of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. The process involved a series of distinct species branching off and evolving separately, with some leading to modern humans, Homo sapiens. Key milestones in human evolution include the appearance of the first hominids (human-like primates), the development of bipedalism (walking upright), and the growth of larger brains. Over time, hominids developed more advanced tools, communication abilities, and social structures. The timeline of human evolution includes several genera such as Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and Homo. Noteworthy species include Ardipithecus ramidus, Australopithecus afarensis 'Lucy,' Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis (Neanderthals), and finally, Homo sapiens. The process of human evolution was influenced by factors such as migration, climate change, and genetic mutations, leading to the diverse populations and cultures that exist today."

    "instruction": "Classify the following excerpt as either fiction or non-fiction, and explain your reasoning.",
    "input": "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.",
    "response": "The excerpt is fiction. This passage is from J.R.R. Tolkien's novel 'The Hobbit,' which is a work of fantasy literature. The presence of a hobbit, a fictional creature, and the detailed description of its living environment, further indicate that the text is a work of imagination and not a factual account grounded in real-world events or experiences."
